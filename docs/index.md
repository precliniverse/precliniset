# Welcome to Precliniset

Precliniset is a specialized platform designed for managing preclinical research data with a focus on **accuracy, traceability, and GLP compliance**.

## High-Level Overview

The platform allows research teams to:

*   **Organize**: Group data into secure Project containers.
*   **Track**: Maintain individual animal metadata across multiple experiments.
*   **Process**: Use the [Import Wizard](features/import_wizard.md) and [Python Pipelines](features/pipelines.md) to automate messy data ingestion.
*   **Analyze**: Perform statistical analysis (ANOVA, t-tests, Survival) directly on experimental data.
*   **Comply**: Automatically generate an audit trail for every change made to the system.

## Getting Started

If you are a new user, we recommend starting with the [Project Management](features/projects.md) guide to learn how to set up your first workspace.
